This is some throw-away code that I am hacking on as a way to learn rust.  

The intention is to build a toy Optical Music Recognition sytem in Rust.

This was inspired by: 
	* Wanting to learn Rust
	* I have a background and interest in both music and Computer Vision
	* The main open source OMR app crashes on launch,
		despite being written in Java, 
		a language for which the only
		selling point is that it runs everywhere.

It is being written before rust has even hit 1.0, so it is probably NOT
worth your time to even look at as an example.

I am only sharing it on github becaues I develop ~everything in the open.
